# Exploring Brazilian Public Capital Market Data

##### Hi, thanks for visiting this repository. The main goal here is to develop creative analysis and exploration of capital markets and alternative publicly available databases using Python notebooks.


## Data scraping

###### In this section, all data scraping notebooks used to extract financial public information from Brazilian websites are presented. The data is accessed using the Python requests library or other methods and is then cleaned primarily through transformations using Pandas DataFrames. Finally, the data is saved in a local SQLite database, making it ready for further analysis using SQL queries.
